# Codex Orchestration

This skill defines a lightweight phase workflow for the `scterm` repo.

## Model

- `arch-term` coordinates (repo lead)
- `cterm` is the sole developer
- `qa-term` runs QA after each sprint delivery

The repo may use either:
- direct sprint PRs to `main`, or
- an explicit `integrate/phase-{P}` branch when a phase needs a staging branch

Use the `pr_target` in the assignment as the source of truth.

## Preconditions

Before starting:
1. `docs/requirements.md` and `docs/architecture.md` describe the sprint.
2. The target branch for the sprint is chosen (`main` or `integrate/phase-{P}`).
3. A worktree exists for the sprint branch.
4. `qa-term`, `rust-qa-agent`, `req-qa`, and `arch-qa` are available.

## Sprint Flow

1. `arch-term` sends a sprint assignment to `cterm` using `dev-template.xml.j2`.
2. `cterm` ACKs, implements, commits, pushes, and reports the branch + SHA.
3. `arch-term` opens/updates the PR.
4. `arch-term` assigns QA to `qa-term` using `qa-template.xml.j2`.
5. `qa-term` runs:
   - `rust-qa-agent`
   - `req-qa`
   - `arch-qa`
6. If QA passes and CI is green, merge proceeds.
7. If QA fails, `arch-term` routes the fixes back to `cterm`.

## CI

Use standard GitHub CLI for PR checks:
- `gh pr checks <PR> --watch`
- `gh pr view <PR> --json mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision`

Do not assume ATM-specific PR monitoring commands exist in this repo.

## Worktrees

Create sprint worktrees with normal git worktree commands when needed:

```bash
git worktree add ../<repo>-worktrees/<branch-name> -b <branch-name> <base-branch>
```

## Required Message Sequence

Every ATM task message must follow:
1. ACK
2. Work
3. Completion summary
4. Completion ACK by receiver
